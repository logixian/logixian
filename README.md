### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently focusing on the fundamentals of ethereum and cryptography, 
  - Cryptography:
    - Discrete Logarithms, Bilinear Pairings, ECC, ECDSA
    - Implementing the above primitives in go and rust
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs: 
    - ZK-SNARKs: Groth16, PLONK, STARK: FRI, Linear PCPs, Recursive SNARKs, Folding Schemes, MSM
    - Practicing zk-circuits for cryptographic primitives using Circom, gnark and halo2 and benchmarking them
- 🌱 I run an ETH node using my local server Geth (EL) + Lighthouse (CL)
- 👀 I’m looking to learn more about ethereum primitives,
  - Networking Layer (libp2p, Kademila DHT) 
  - Data Availability
  - Restaking
  - L2 Rollups 
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- 💬 Ask me about (past experience),
  - applied machine learning
  - product data science 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opensource Ethereum projects
