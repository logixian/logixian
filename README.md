### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently learning the fundamentals Cryptography (Discrete Logarithms, Bilinear Pairings, ECC, ECDSA) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs - PLONK, STARK - FRI, Linear PCPs, Recursive SNARKs). Practicing zk-circuits using Circom, halo2.  
- 🌱 I run an ETH node and building a query engine to analyze Ethereum (PoS) on-chain data
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Availability, Restaking, L2 Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- 💬 Ask me about (past experience): applied machine learning, product data science 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opensource Ethereum projects
