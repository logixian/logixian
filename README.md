### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently learning the fundamentals,
  - Cryptography
    - Discrete Logarithms
    - Bilinear Pairings
    - ECC 
    - ECDSA
  - Implementing the above primitives in go and rust
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
    - ZK-SNARKs: PLONK
    - STARK: FRI
    - Linear PCPs
    - Recursive SNARKs
  - Practicing zk-circuits for cryptographic primitives using Circom, gnark and halo2 and benchmarking them
- 🌱 I run an ETH node
- 🌱 I am building a query engine to analyze Ethereum (PoS) on-chain data
- 👀 I’m interested in 
  - Data Availability
  - Restaking
  - L2 Rollups 
  - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- 💬 Ask me about (past experience): 
  - applied machine learning
  - product data science 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on opensource Ethereum projects
